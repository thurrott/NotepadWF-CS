# .NETpad

**(C#/.NET Framework 4.7x/Windows Forms version)**

.NETpad is a basic clone of Microsoft Notepad that was created by Paul Thurrott ([@thurrott](https://www.twitter.com/thurrott)) with the help of Rafael Rivera ([@withinrafael](https://www.twitter.com/withinrafael)), several outside contributors, and, thanks to his books, Charles Petzold. It is technologically unsophisticated and has many bugs. But .NETpad provides most Notepad features, albeit in U.S. English only, and adds a few additional features that Notepad lacks, including:

- Optional auto-save every 30 seconds
- Themes with the ability to arbitrarily choose a new background and text color
- Word count, displayed in the status bar

[I documented how I created a Visual Basic version of this app on Thurrott.com](https://www.thurrott.com/tag/the-winforms-notepad-project). And I am now updating this C# version of the app with some more modern features and bug fixes. 

This version of .NETpad should work on all supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11.
